Description: Test for BZ#1020854 (rsyslogd with imtcp module aborts with core-dump)
Author: Karel Srot <ksrot@redhat.com>
Bug summary: rsyslogd with imtcp module aborts with core-dump when stopping
Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020854

Since syslog.socket is currently useless this test just checks whether syslog.socket doesn't
trigger rsyslog.service execution.
