Description: uses LUKS block device to test clevis luksmeta binding
Author: Jiri Jaburek <jjaburek@redhat.com>

NOTE: This test ***does not*** verify that clevis can decrypt the
bound LUKS volumes, as this code is only present in the dracut plugin.
Instead, this test tries many combinations of interactive/batch and
other features of bind-luks, and another test uses one of these methods
to test the dracut-based decryption.
